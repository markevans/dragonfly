# Caching and Performance
Dragonfly serves content *on-the-fly*, that is, when a request is made to a url given by
{% highlight ruby %}
url = Dragonfly.app.fetch('my/stored/image').thumb('300x200').url
{% endhighlight %}

then Dragonfly will do exactly what the job says, i.e.

  1. fetch the content stored with uid "my/stored/image"
  2. process it to make a thumbnail with dimensions 300x200

Doing this on every request is expensive, so it's wise to use a caching proxy, so that after the first
request the server simply returns the cached response.

Dragonfly sends `Cache-Control` and `ETag` headers in its responses to let us do this (for a well-written discussion of this, see [this blog post](http://tomayko.com/writings/things-caches-do)).

Simply put a proxy like [Rack::Cache](http://rtomayko.github.com/rack-cache), [Varnish](http://varnish.projects.linpro.no) or [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org) in front of the app and subsequent requests will be served super-quickly straight out of the cache.

For simple use of Rack::Cache with rails see [Rails]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 0000-01-02-rails %}#caching).

To customize Dragonfly's response headers, inside a `configure` block, you can use something like

{% highlight ruby %}
response_header "Cache-Control", "public, max-age=3600"
{% endhighlight %}

or

{% highlight ruby %}
response_header "Cache-Control" do |job, request, headers|
  if job.fetch_step && job.fetch_step.uid =~ /2012/
    "public, max-age=100000"
  else
    "private"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Setting the header to `nil` removes the header from the response.

## Using a CDN
Some CDNs are configured to make a request to your domain on the first request and return the cached version thereafter, using the same url path.

You can use `url_host` to point urls to the CDN instead of your local server.

For example, a url
{% highlight ruby %}
Dragonfly.app.fetch('some/uid').thumb('300x200').url
{% endhighlight %}

normally returns something like
{% highlight ruby %}
"/W1siZiIsInNvbWUvdWlkIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIl1d"
{% endhighlight %}

Adding in a `configure` block
{% highlight ruby %}
url_host 'http://some.cdn'
{% endhighlight %}

makes the url
{% highlight ruby %}
"http://some.cdn/W1siZiIsInNvbWUvdWlkIl0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCIzMDB4MjAwIl1d"
{% endhighlight %}

## Serving remotely (directly from the datastore)
If the datastore supports it, you can get the url for stored content using
{% highlight ruby %}
Dragonfly.app.remote_url_for(uid)
    # e.g. http://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/04/01/03/03/05/243/file.jpg
{% endhighlight %}

or from a model attachment
{% highlight ruby %}
my_model.attachment.remote_url
    # e.g. http://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2011/04/01/03/03/05/243/file.jpg
{% endhighlight %}

## Performing processing on upload
See [Up-front processing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 0000-01-04-models %}#up-front)

## Processing *on-the-fly* and serving remotely
Serving processed versions of content such as thumbnails remotely is a bit more tricky as we need to upload the thumbnail
to the datastore in the on-the-fly manner.

Dragonfly provides a way of doing this using `define_url` and `before_serve` methods.

**The details of keeping track of/expiring these thumbnails is up to you.**

We need to keep track of which thumbnails have been already created, by storing a uid for each one.
Below is an example using an ActiveRecord `Thumb` table to keep track of already created thumbnail uids.
It has two string columns; `signature` and `uid`.

{% highlight ruby %}
Dragonfly.app.configure do

  # Override the .url method...
  define_url do |app, job, opts|
    thumb = Thumb.find_by_signature(job.signature)
    # If (fetch 'some_uid' then resize to '40x40') has been stored already, give the datastore's remote url ...
    if thumb
      app.datastore.url_for(thumb.uid)
    # ...otherwise give the local Dragonfly server url
    else
      app.server.url_for(job)
    end
  end

  # Before serving from the local Dragonfly server...
  before_serve do |job, env|
    # ...store the thumbnail in the datastore...
    uid = job.store

    # ...keep track of its uid so next time we can serve directly from the datastore
    Thumb.create!(uid: uid, signature: job.signature)
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

This would give

{% highlight ruby %}
app.fetch('some_uid').thumb('40x40').url    # normal Dragonfly url e.g. /media/WhbBls...
{% endhighlight %}

then from the second time onwards

{% highlight ruby %}
app.fetch('some_uid').thumb('40x40').url    # http://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/2011...
{% endhighlight %}

The above is just an example - there are a number of things you could do with `before_serve` and `define_url` -
you could use e.g. Redis or some key-value store to keep track of thumbnails.

You'd also probably want a way of expiring the thumbnails or destroying them when the original is destroyed, but this
is left up to you as it's outside of the scope of Dragonfly.
